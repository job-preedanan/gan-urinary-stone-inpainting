# GAN-Based Urinary Stones Inpainting Augmentation

We provided two main files:
- cascaded_dilatedNet_gam.py : training GAN for inpainting the stone in the missing part
- generate_test.py : testing stone inpainting

This code is the part of the following paper:
> W. Preedanan et al., "Improvement of Urinary Stone Segmentation Using GAN-Based Urinary Stones Inpainting Augmentation," in IEEE Access, vol. 10, pp. 115131-115142, 2022
